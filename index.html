   <h1>Surviving Web Design</h1>
   <h2>Here are some tips to help you along the way</h2>
  <section>
   <ul>
    <li><b>Don't start out with css</b></li>
      <p>Css is important in making the final website come to life, but first make sure that you have a solid index and then move on to adding some design or color.
    </p>
    <li><b>Take notes</b></li>
    <p>This is a computer class so you ask yourself why would I need to take notes.  Taking notes serves as a way for you to become more familiar with the coding language 
     and just to make sure that you actually understand what it going on.
